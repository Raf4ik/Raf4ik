  <summary>About me:</summary><br>

  I like to create in life, so programming was the perfect solution for me!

  Constant learning and improvement of skills, that's what drives me so that I can release cool products!

  From the first minutes I fell in love with Python and everything connected with it, perhaps this is my main choice, but there are so many interesting things in the world that my horizons are constantly expanding and, as a result, the goal is to become a full-stack developer.
